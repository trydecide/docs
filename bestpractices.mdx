To help you get the most accurate insights and compelling visualizations, we've compiled a list of best practices. Following these guidelines will enhance the quality of your results and streamline your workflow.

### 1. Start with a Clear Objective

Before you upload your data, have a clear idea of what you want to discover. Vague questions lead to generic answers.
<Tip title="Pro-Tip">
Instead of asking, *"Look at my sales data"*, try a more specific prompt like, *"Analyze my quarterly sales data to identify the top-performing product category and the region with the most growth compared to last quarter."*
</Tip>

A clear goal helps Decide focus its analysis on the metrics that matter most to you.

### 2. Provide High-Quality, Well-Structured Data

The quality of your output is directly tied to the quality of your input. You can use Decide to clean your data. For the best results, ensure your data is:
- **Clean:** Remove duplicates, correct typos, and handle missing values before uploading.
- **Well-Structured:** Use clear, descriptive column headers (e.g., `Date`, `ProductName`, `SalesAmount` instead of `Col1`, `PN`, `Sales`).
- **Appropriate Format:** CSV or XLSX files are ideal for most tabular data analysis.
<Warning>
**Garbage In, Garbage Out:** If your data is messy or poorly formatted, Decide's ability to provide accurate insights will be limited. A few minutes of data cleaning can save you a lot of time later.
</Warning>

### 3. Craft Specific and Detailed Prompts

The more context you provide, the better Decide can tailor its response to your needs.
- **Specify Chart Types:** "Create a bar chart of sales by country."
- **Define Timeframes:** "Show me the weekly user engagement trend for the last 90 days."
- **Request Calculations:** "Calculate the average profit margin for each product and visualize it as a horizontal bar chart."
- **Ask for Customization:** "Generate a pie chart showing the market share of our competitors. Use our brand colors and add percentage labels."

### 4. Iterate and Refine Your Analysis

Data analysis is often a process of discovery. Don't expect to get everything you need in a single prompt.
1.  **Start Broad:** Begin with a high-level request, like "Give me an overview of this customer feedback data."
2.  **Identify Interesting Points:** Look at the initial analysis and find areas you want to explore further.
3.  **Ask Follow-up Questions:** Drill down with more specific prompts, such as, "You mentioned 'user interface' is a common theme. Can you show me the sentiment trend for comments containing that phrase?"
This iterative approach allows you to uncover deeper, more nuanced insights.

### 5. Choose the Right Output for Your Audience

### 6. Always Review and Apply Your Expertise

Decide is an incredibly powerful tool, but it's an assistant, not a replacement for your domain knowledge. Always review the outputs to ensure they make sense in the context of your business or research. Use the insights as a starting point, and apply your expertise to draw final conclusions.
