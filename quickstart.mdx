# Getting Started

**Step 1: Choose How to Start**

You can upload `.csv` or `.sav` (SPSS) files directly after creating a user account.

- Click the **Upload** button.
- Select your data file.
- Wait for the upload to complete.

<Note>
You can also skip uploading and just ask a question — Decide will fetch public data for you!

**Step 2: Start a Conversation**
![Upload any file type you want](images/file-upload.png)

Describe what you want to do. Be as specific or general as you like — Decide understands context and may ask clarifying questions if needed.
Example requests:
  - "Show me a summary of this dataset."
  - "What are the top trends in my sales data?"
  - "Can you visualize the age distribution?"
  - "Analyze my dataset"

**Step 3: Watch the Magic**

Decide will analyze your request, understand your data, and execute the changes in real-time. You'll see exactly what's happening as it works.
