# Getting Started

<Steps>
  <Step title="Step 1: Choose How to Start">
    You can upload `.csv`, `.xls` (Excel), or `.sav` (SPSS) files directly to Decide.
    <Info>
      Before you begin, create an account.
    </Info>

    - Click the **Upload** button.
    - Select your data file.
    - Wait for the upload to complete.

    <Note>
    You can also skip uploading and just ask a question — Decide will fetch public data for you!
    </Note>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Step 2: Write your Prompt">
    ![Upload any file type you want](images/file-upload.png)

    Describe what you want to do. Be as specific or general as you like — Decide understands context and may ask clarifying questions if needed.
    Example requests:
      - "Show me a summary of this dataset."
      - "What are the top trends in my sales data?"
      - "Can you visualize the age distribution?"
      - "Analyze my dataset"
  </Step>
  <Step title="Step 3: Watch the Magic">
    Decide will analyze your request, understand your data, and execute the changes in real-time. You'll see exactly what's happening as it works.

    Decide can also generate visualisations of your analysis.
