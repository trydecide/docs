# Getting Started

**Step 1: Choose How to Start**

<Columns cols={2}>
  <Card>
    <b>Ask a question (no upload needed)</b><br/>
    Just type your question in the chat box. Decide will search public data sources to answer you.
    <ul>
      <li>"What is the average income in California?"</li>
      <li>"Show me the latest unemployment rates by state."</li>
      <li>"Find population trends for Japan."</li>
    </ul>
  </Card>
  <Card>
    <b>Upload your own data file</b><br/>
    Upload any CSV or SPSS file to analyze your private data.
    <ul>
      <li>Supports: .csv, .sav</li>
      <li>Data stays private</li>
    </ul>
  </Card>
</Columns>

**Step 2: Start a Conversation**

<Card>
  Open the AI chat panel and describe what you want to do. Be as specific or general as you like — Decide understands context and may ask clarifying questions if needed.
  <div style={{ background: "#181818", borderRadius: "8px", padding: "1em", marginTop: "1em" }}>
    <b>Example requests:</b><br/>
    "Show me a summary of this dataset."<br/>
    "What are the top trends in my sales data?"<br/>
    "Can you visualize the age distribution?"
  </div>
</Card>
