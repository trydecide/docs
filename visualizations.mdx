Decide can create a wide variety of visualizations to help you understand and present your data effectively. It primarily uses powerful Python libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn to generate clear, professional, and insightful charts.


<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Comparison Charts">
    Comparison Charts are used to compare values across different categories.
    <Accordion title="Bar Charts (Vertical & Horizontal)">
      These are perfect for comparing quantities for distinct groups. For example, sales figures across different products.

    <Accordion title="Stacked Bar/Area Charts">
      Show how a total is divided into parts and how those parts change over time or across categories.
